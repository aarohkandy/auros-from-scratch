#  AurOS first boot: what the person chose in the installer
#
#  The installer (AurBridge) asks for a language, a keyboard, a time
#  zone, a look and a way of working, and for a long time dropped every
#  answer but one: the journal it hands the staging environment carries
#  only the profile. So a person who picked "Español", a Spanish
#  keyboard and the Moss look got an American desktop in Nocturne.
#
#  AurBridge now writes the answers to \EFI\AurOS\choices.conf on this
#  machine's EFI partition, beside the installer it started -- the one
#  place both sides of the restart can reach and the install leaves as
#  it found it. This finds that file, checks every value against what
#  this system actually has, applies what passes, and records what it
#  applied in /etc/auros/installer-choices.conf so that Ferry, which
#  later copies settings across from Windows, does not overwrite a
#  choice somebody made on purpose with the default they were offered.
#
#  THE FILE IS INPUT, NOT CODE. It is never sourced. Each value is
#  matched against a pattern before it is used, and a value that fails
#  is reported and skipped; nothing here can make the boot fail.
#
#    choices.conf, as AurBridge writes it:
#
#      language=es_ES.UTF-8
#      keyboard=xkb:es            or  keyboard=klid:0000040A
#      timezone=iana:Europe/Madrid or  timezone=windows:Romance Standard Time
#      theme=moss
#      shell=taskbar
#
#  For tests: AUROS_CHOICES_FILE names the file (skipping the search),
#  and AUROS_CHOICES_ROOT is a directory standing in for / -- in which
#  case nothing is run, only files are written (tools/choicestest.sh).
