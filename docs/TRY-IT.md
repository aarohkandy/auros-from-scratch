# Trying the no-stick test build on a spare PC

This is for **a PC whose files you do not need**, or a virtual machine.
The installer is unsigned, and this is the first time its Windows half
meets a real computer. Read `docs/RELEASE.md`, "What the test build is,
and is not", before starting.

## What you need

- A PC with **Windows 10 or 11**, started the modern way (UEFI). Almost
  every PC from 2013 on is.
- **About 50 GB free on C:**. AurOS needs 28 GB once it is installed,
  Windows keeps 8 GB, and the 5 GB copy of AurOS stays on C: while it
  installs (plus 1.8 GB of download for a while).
- A wired or reliable internet connection: about **1.8 GB** is
  downloaded. It resumes if it drops.
- **The charger plugged in**, for the whole thing. The battery level
  does not matter (a worn battery at 0% on the charger is fine).
- USB sticks and memory cards can stay plugged in: the installer says
  so and never writes to them.

## Before you start, in Windows

Nothing. If the check finds something, the stop page lists each
problem in one line with what happens about it, and **Fix these for
me** does it:

| Problem | What the installer does |
|---|---|
| Fast Startup on | switches it off (always, as its first step) |
| Not enough space on C: | empties the Recycle Bin, Windows' temp folders and Disk Cleanup's leftovers (not Downloads, not the previous Windows) |
| Drive encrypted (BitLocker / Device encryption) | switches it off, then waits for Windows to finish |
| Updates waiting for a restart, or a drive check pending | restarts Windows once, and opens again by itself after you sign in |
| Charger unplugged | nothing to press: plug it in and the page carries on by itself |

A USB stick, a memory card, an empty built-in card reader, little
memory: not stops. The first page lists them under *Good to know*, one
line each, and carries on.

Some things nothing on the PC can fix: a PC that starts the old way
(BIOS), a Windows-on-ARM laptop, an NVMe drive that Intel's storage
driver remaps (some 2016-2020 Dell and HP laptops; Linux cannot see
it), a failing drive, some multi-drive setups. Then the page says so in
one line, before anything is downloaded, and changes nothing.

Leave **Secure Boot on**; AurOS starts with it on. On the rare PC that
trusts only Windows (some Secured-core laptops), the installer stops on
its first page and shows the one firmware setting to switch on.

## If antivirus stops it

The test installer is unsigned and new, so antivirus programs that
judge files by how many people have run them will hold it. It also
carries about 30 MB of start-up files, asks for administrator rights,
and writes to the disk and the firmware's start-up list: exactly what
they are built to be wary of.

- **Avast / AVG** show *"Suspicious file detected"*, upload the file
  to their Threat Labs, then *"This needs a closer look"* and block it
  "for a few hours". Either wait for their verdict, or open Avast →
  *Menu* → *Settings* → *General* → *Exceptions* → *Add exception* and
  add the downloaded file. Download it again afterwards if Avast moved
  it to the Virus Chest.
- **Microsoft Defender** is the SmartScreen step below.
- **Any other antivirus**: add an exception for the file the same way.

**Also pause its real-time protection while the installer runs**, up to
*Restart now*. Before the restart it only reads the drive, downloads
into `C:\AurOS`, writes its files under `\EFI\AurOS` and sets a one-time
start-up entry; nothing resizes or rewrites the Windows drive until
after the restart. A behaviour blocker that stops it part way therefore
leaves Windows as it was, but it will not install either; if that
happens, take a photo of what the antivirus said. Turn protection back
on afterwards.

## If nothing opens at all

If double-clicking shows *"The application has failed to start because
its side-by-side configuration is incorrect"*, that is the test build
published on 2026-09-25 (SHA-256 `3e32e929...`); Windows refused its
manifest before any of it ran, and nothing on the PC was changed.
Download the installer again: the current one is checked on a real
Windows machine before it is published (`.github/workflows/windows.yml`).

## Running it

1. Download `AurOS-Installer-test.exe` from
   https://github.com/ComputerDude771/auros-from-scratch/raw/image-desktop/AurOS-Installer-test.exe
   and double-click it. (Its SHA-256 is in the `image-desktop`
   branch's README, with what was tested on real Windows.)
2. Windows shows **"Windows protected your PC"**, because the file is
   not signed yet. Click **More info**, then **Run anyway**.
   (If there is no *Run anyway*, the PC has Smart App Control on, and
   an unsigned installer cannot run on it. Use a different PC.)
3. Windows asks **"Do you want to allow this app to make changes?"** →
   **Yes**.
4. **The first page checks the PC by itself** while you read it (it only
   reads). When it says *This computer can take AurOS*, press **Next**.
   If something stops it, the page says what in one line each; press
   **Fix these for me** (see above).
5. **Pick the look you want**: *Like Windows* (chosen to begin with),
   *Like a Mac*, *Big and simple* or *One thing at a time*. Each is a
   picture of the screen you get; all four use the light Sandstone
   look. Press **Next**. Language, keyboard and time zone come from
   Windows without a question. You can change the look later in
   AurOS's Settings.
6. **Ready** says what stays (Windows and your files), how much room
   AurOS takes (up to 40 GB) and what Windows keeps free, that the PC
   restarts once, and how long it takes on this PC (longer on a hard
   disk than an SSD; measured from the download already running). Press
   **Install AurOS**. Nothing to type, and nothing that must be ticked. It checks the PC once more, then shows one bar
   and the time left. You can leave it: it keeps the PC awake.
7. When it is ready it says **Ready to restart** and restarts by itself
   after 60 seconds, counting down on the screen. **Restart now** does it
   at once; **Not yet** stops the count. Do not close the window
   instead: closing it before the restart takes everything back, on
   purpose.

If it cannot go on at all (a Windows-on-ARM laptop, a PC that starts
the older way, an Intel-remapped NVMe drive, a failing drive), the page
says why in one line and *What you can do* in another, and its one
button is **Close**.

Narrator can read every page and press its buttons (the window answers
as an accessible object, not one blank picture).

Pictures of every page: `docs/shots/wizard/`.

## After the restart

- The screen shows **text**, not a desktop. That is the installer. It
  makes the Windows drive smaller (minutes, or longer on an old hard
  drive), saves a copy of the PC's start-up onto the drive, copies
  AurOS, checks it, and starts it. **Do not switch the PC off** while
  it says *Making room on the Windows drive*.
- If it stops with a sentence and `verdict=...`, **take a photo of the
  screen** and send it. A stop before *Making room* has changed
  nothing; switch the PC off and on and Windows starts as before.
- On its first start AurOS applies what you chose in the installer. The
  language sets dates, numbers and the programs that carry their own
  translations; AurOS's own menus are English for now.
- When AurOS starts, it asks **whether it works**. Say **yes** to make
  AurOS what the PC starts from now on; say **no** and the PC goes back
  to starting Windows. Windows is still there either way.

## Getting to Windows afterwards

Windows stays in the PC's start-up menu. Press the menu key when the PC
switches on (often **F12**, **F9** or **Esc**; the maker's logo screen
usually says which) and choose **Windows Boot Manager**. AurOS's own
start menu also has a **Windows** entry.

The `C:\AurOS` folder keeps the 5 GB copy of AurOS. Once AurOS works
you can delete it from Windows.

## Putting Windows back

To remove AurOS and give Windows all of its drive back:

- in AurOS: **Settings → Put Windows back**, then press **Remove AurOS
  and put Windows back** twice (the first press says what goes with
  it). The PC restarts into the restore, which shows text while it
  works and then **switches itself off**; switch it on again and
  Windows starts. **Do not switch it off while the text is still
  moving.**
- or, if AurOS itself does not start: in AurOS's start-up menu (the list
  that appears for three seconds when AurOS starts), choose **Put Windows
  back (remove AurOS)**, then **Yes**.

Everything saved inside AurOS goes with it; copy what you want to keep
onto a memory stick first. If the restore stops with a sentence and
`verdict=...`, take a photo of the screen, as with the install.

This is in the v3 image, which is what the installer downloads from
2026-09-26 on. A PC installed before that (with the v2 image) has the
restore on its disk but nothing on screen that starts it; install again
with the current installer to get it.
