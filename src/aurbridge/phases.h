/* phases.h — what AurBridge does to a computer before the restart.
 *
 * docs/AURBRIDGE.md numbers eleven phases. Four of them happen on
 * Windows, and this is those four:
 *
 *   0 INSPECT   look, and refuse. Nothing is opened for writing.
 *   1 CONSENT   the user agrees, in words, to a thing named plainly --
 *               and if the drive is BitLocker-encrypted, proves she
 *               has the key before anything can make her need it.
 *   2 PREPARE   the memory stick: the AurOS image, a place for the
 *               installer's notes, and room for a copy of this
 *               machine's Windows startup. Consumes a memory stick;
 *               changes nothing on the computer.
 *   3 HANDOFF   the staging environment into the EFI partition, and a
 *               ONE-SHOT boot entry. This is the last thing that
 *               happens before the one restart.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE WRITES TO THE COMPUTER'S OWN DISK. Not one byte. The
 * shrink, the partition table and the image all happen after the
 * restart, in src/aurstage, where nothing is mounted. The complete
 * list of what phases 0-3 change is: the memory stick, two files in a
 * directory on the EFI partition that AurOS created, and two firmware
 * variables. plat.h is what makes that checkable rather than claimed:
 * plat_write() refuses every disk but the stick.
 *
 * AND EVERY PHASE IS UNDOABLE UNTIL THE RESTART. ab_abort() clears
 * BootNext, and a machine that has had phases 0 to 3 done to it and
 * then aborted is a machine with some files on its EFI partition and
 * a memory stick it did not have before. Nothing else.
