/* ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *  AurBridge preflight — decide whether this machine may be touched.
 *
 *  Design rule: REFUSE FIRST. A refused install costs one user. A failed
 *  install costs a user, their data, a support case, and possibly a
 *  lawsuit. Refusing is a first-class product outcome here, not an error
 *  dialog — every BLOCK carries a plain-language remedy.
 *
 *  Nothing in this header writes to a disk. Preflight is strictly
 *  read-only; the destructive phases live elsewhere and refuse to start
 *  unless a preflight report says PF_OK.
 *
 *  Safety invariant: UNKNOWN IS NEVER OK. A check that cannot determine
 *  its answer blocks. Every query below therefore has a failure path
 *  that ends in a BLOCK, not in a silent zero.
 *
 *  Each check maps to a risk in docs/research/red-team.md (R-numbers in
 *  the check comments) so the register and the code cannot drift apart.

/* ── the recovery USB (R4 · R11) ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * R11 wants every removable disk unplugged, so that writing to the
 * wrong target is physically impossible. R4 makes a recovery USB
 * mandatory and phase 2 has to write to it. Both cannot hold at once,
 * so exactly one stick is let through: the one the user nominates here.
 * Everything else removable still refuses.
 *
 * The nomination is by disk serial number because that is the only
 * identifier that survives a replug into a different port — drive
 * letters and PhysicalDriveN numbers do not. A disk whose serial is
 * empty, or too short to be an identifier, can never be nominated: we
 * would be unable to tell it from the user's backup drive.
 *
 * Intended use: run pf_run() once with no nomination, show the user the
 * removable disks the report found (model, size, serial), then call
 * this with the serial of the one they picked and run pf_run() again.
 * Pass NULL or "" to withdraw the nomination; that is the default.
 *
 * Nominating a stick does not make it safe to write to, and does not
 * check that it is present. It only stops preflight refusing because it
 * is plugged in. Preflight still never writes, so nothing reachable
 * from here can touch the stick.
 *
 * Not thread-safe against a concurrent pf_run(); set it before the
 * wizard's worker thread starts. */
