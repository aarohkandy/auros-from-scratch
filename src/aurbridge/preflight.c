/* ── R7: how much can this volume actually give up? ──────────────── */

 * GetDiskFreeSpaceEx answers a different question -- free space *inside*
 * the filesystem -- and AURBRIDGE.md records measuring that one instead
 * as the mistake that survives review. What matters is where the data
 * ends, and that is written down in $Bitmap.
 *
 * One pass over the bitmap yields two floors, because two resizers care
 * about two different things:
 *
 *   offline  ntfsresize, which AurBridge uses in phase 4, relocates
 *            every file it finds. Its floor is the number of allocated
 *            clusters, wherever on the volume they sit.
 *   online   Windows' own shrink will not move the pagefile, hiberfil,
 *            VSS store, $MFT, $Bitmap or $UsnJrnl, so its floor is the
 *            *last* allocated cluster. This is the number behind R7's
 *            "30 GB free may yield 2 GB offered".
 *
 * The offline floor decides, because it is the shrink this product
 * performs. The online floor is reported because it is what the user
 * would be offered if they tried this themselves in Disk Management,
 * and the gap between the two is usually the whole story.
 *
 * FSCTL_GET_VOLUME_BITMAP is a documented read-only query. The two
 * obvious alternatives are not usable here: FSCTL_SHRINK_VOLUME's
 * ShrinkPrepare needs a write handle and leaves the volume in a prepared
 * state that must be committed or aborted, which preflight may not do;
 * and `diskpart shrink querymax` means spawning a console process from a
 * GUI installer and parsing localised text, for a number that describes
 * the online shrink we do not perform.
 */
/* What AurOS asks for, and what Windows must be left with. The second
 * number is not slack: Windows Update alone wants roughly this much
 * free, and ntfsresize needs headroom above the data it relocates.
 * Shrinking to the last free byte is an install that fits and a PC that
 * stops working a month later. */
