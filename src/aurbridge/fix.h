/* fix.h — what the installer does about a problem, instead of describing it.
 *
 * The check (preflight.c) finds problems and explains them. This decides,
 * for each one, which of four things is true:
 *
 *   FIX_AUTO     the installer can fix it now, with one press, and does
 *   FIX_RESTART  it needs Windows restarted; the installer restarts it and
 *                opens itself again afterwards, where it left off
 *   FIX_WAIT     only the person can do it (plug in the charger, take out
 *                a USB stick); the installer notices by itself and carries on
 *   FIX_CANNOT   nothing on this PC can fix it; one plain sentence says why
 *
 * and gives the problem and the fix in one short line each, because the
 * page that shows them is read by somebody who wanted AurOS, not a report.
 * A problem this table does not know falls back to the check's own title
 * and remedy, so a new check is never invisible here.
