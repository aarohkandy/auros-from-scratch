/* plan.h — where the new partitions go.
 *
 * THE MISTAKE THIS FILE IS SHAPED AROUND
 *
 * The first design for stage C computed the new partitions from the
 * END OF THE DISK: put the recovery partition at
 * `last_usable - 600 MiB`, and run the AurOS root from the shrunk
 * Windows volume up to it.
 *
 * On the layout docs/AURBRIDGE.md itself calls typical -- ESP, MSR,
 * C:, OEM recovery -- that is wrong on every machine. The OEM recovery
 * partition sits at the END of the disk. Shrinking C: creates a gap
 * BETWEEN C: AND WinRE; it creates nothing at the end. Both computed
 * extents land on top of WinRE, the overlap guard fires, and the
 * product refuses its entire target population while believing it is
 * being careful.
 *
 * So: everything here is computed inside the gap, and the gap's far
 * edge comes from gpt_gap_end() -- that is, from the PARTITION TABLE.
 * Never from the /sys survey, which is readdir() order, capped at
 * STAGE_MAX_PART, and holds only the partitions the kernel chose to
 * instantiate. A partition the block layer skipped is invisible to the
 * survey, and laying the AurOS root across one is not a mistake
 * anything later can catch.
 *
 * EVERY NUMBER HERE IS IN LOGICAL BLOCKS, the disk's own, which is
 * 4096 on a 4Kn drive. The survey's `start_lba` is in 512-byte units
 * whatever the drive is -- a kernel convention, not a fact about the
 * disk -- so the two are never mixed and the conversion happens once,
 * at the door.
