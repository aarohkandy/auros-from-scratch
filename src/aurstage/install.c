 * The other half of rule 2. This runs in the same staging environment
 * as the install, started by `aurstage.restore` on the kernel command
 * line, which is what the button in the AurOS settings panel arms
 * before it restarts the machine. It does NOT run inside AurOS: see
 * the header of rescue.h for why an in-place restore cannot be safe.
 *
 * WHICH SAVED COPY, when there are normally two. The stick's and the
 * machine's own are byte-identical when both are healthy, so the
 * choice only matters when one of them is not -- and the one most
 * likely not to be is the copy sitting on the disk that has gone
 * wrong. So the stick is preferred, every candidate is opened and
 * fully verified before any of them is used, and a machine with a
 * damaged stick and a good on-disk copy still gets its Windows back.
