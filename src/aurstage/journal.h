/* journal.h — what AurBridge recorded about this machine, and whether
 * the machine still matches it.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL
 *
 * docs/AURBRIDGE.md, phase 3: `BootNext` is one-shot and
 * self-reverting, which is the property that makes a failed first boot
 * a non-event. But a user can cancel a restart, and an application can
 * block one. An armed `BootNext` that is consumed THREE DAYS LATER,
 * after Windows has updated, defragmented, hibernated and grown its
 * pagefile, is a trap: the staging environment would come up believing
 * facts about a disk that has moved underneath it.
 *
 * So the staging environment re-verifies the machine against what was
 * recorded -- disk serial, GPT hash, NTFS start LBA and sector count --
 * and aborts on any mismatch. That is not a nicety; it is the thing
 * that makes the one-shot boot safe to arm at all.
 *
 * THE FORMAT IS JSON, and the reader below is deliberately strict and
 * small: a flat object of strings and integers, nothing nested, no
 * arrays, no escapes beyond the ones a path needs. It is written by a
 * Windows program in another language and read here by a program
 * running as root on somebody's only copy of their photographs, so
 * anything it does not understand exactly is a refusal.
