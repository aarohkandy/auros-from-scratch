/* shrink.h — asking how small the Windows volume can get, and whether

 *
 * NOTHING IN THIS FILE WRITES. Stage B is read-only by construction;
 * `ntfsresize` is invoked with --no-action and --info only, and the
 * surface test reads. The function that actually resizes belongs to
 * stage C and does not exist yet.
 *
 * --force IS UNREACHABLE BY CONSTRUCTION, not merely unpassed.
 * docs/AURBRIDGE.md requires that, and the reason is that it
 * authorises resizing a filesystem whose own metadata Windows has
 * declared untrustworthy -- which is R9 verbatim -- and it is one word
 * away at all times. The argument vectors here are fixed arrays in
 * this file; there is no parameter through which a caller could add it.

/* THE SAME TOOL, THE OTHER WAY, AND THE ONE PLACE --force IS ALLOWED.
 *
 * Growing a volume back is what src/aurstage/rescue.c does to put
 * Windows back, and it cannot be done without --force. The reason is
 * not an oversight anywhere; it is a fact about the tool and it was
 * measured rather than assumed:
 *
 *   ntfsresize marks a volume DIRTY after every successful resize, so
 *   that Windows runs chkdsk at the next start. That is correct and
 *   wanted. But ntfsresize also REFUSES to touch a dirty volume --
 *   "Volume is scheduled for check. Run chkdsk /f and please try
 *   again, or see option -f." So the volume our own installer shrank
 *   is, by construction, one that cannot be grown back without -f.
 *   Without this the restore puts the partition entry back to its full
 *   size and leaves the filesystem inside it small, for ever, on every
 *   machine.
 *
 * The review that removed --force from the shrink was right, and this
 * does not undo it. Its objection was that --force blanket-suppresses
 * the refusal that is the only guard against R9 -- a volume whose
 * metadata cannot be trusted. So the guard is not removed, it is moved
 * somewhere it can be made narrower than ntfsresize's own: rescue.c
 * reads the volume's state ITSELF, with ntfs_read_state, and passes 1
 * here only when the single thing wrong with the volume is the dirty
 * bit, the log is clean, it is not hibernated, none of the three is
 * UNSURE, and its NTFS serial number is the one the capture recorded.
 * Under those conditions the dirty bit is provably the one our own
 * shrink set. Every other verdict is still a hard refusal, and the
 * user still gets "run chkdsk from Windows and try again".
 *
 * shrink_do() passes 0 and always will. That is the invariant: the one
 * irreversible step in the product never forces anything. */

/* HOW SMALL TO MAKE WINDOWS -- which is NOT "as small as it will go".
 *
 * The first version shrank the Windows volume to ntfsresize's absolute
 * floor (`smallest`), so AurOS swallowed every free byte on the disk.
 * The 2026-10-23 journey audit measured the cost: on a 1 TB hard disk
 * that is a ~3-hour surface test and a ~30-80-minute shrink, it leaves
 * Windows essentially full, and it makes "AurOS will use about 28 GB" a
 * lie.
 *
 * So Windows is shrunk by only what AurOS needs, with headroom:
 *
 *   AurOS's share = min(40 GiB, what can be freed while leaving Windows
 *                        max(20 GiB, 15% of the volume) free),
 *   but never less than `install_need` (min_root + the boot partition +
 *   the saved copy), never below a 16 GiB floor, and never more than
 *   can be reclaimed (current - smallest).
 *
 * Returns the TARGET SIZE for the Windows partition (bytes). Pure
 * arithmetic, no I/O, so both the staging side and -- once the Windows
 * fast path lands -- the Windows side can compute the same number, and
 * a test can check it without a disk.
 *
 * Deliberately permissive: it never refuses, it clamps. The amount it
 * frees from the END of Windows joins any unallocated space already
 * after it, and plan_compute() works in that whole gap, so plan_compute
 * stays the authority on whether there is room -- a genuine shortfall
 * surfaces there, with the disk untouched. On a real machine (Windows
 * filling the disk up to WinRE, no pre-existing gap) the share equals
 * the amount freed, so AurOS gets 40 GiB and Windows keeps the rest; on
 * a tiny volume the need exceeds everything reclaimable, so it returns
 * `smallest` and takes it all, exactly as before. */
