/* gpt.h — the partition table, read and rewritten.
 *
 * THE SINGLE MOST DANGEROUS WRITE IN THE PRODUCT lives behind this
 * header, so it is worth saying what it is: one sector, LBA 1, written
 * after everything else is already on the disk and flushed. Rule 4 of
 * docs/AURBRIDGE.md -- "one atomic commit point per destructive phase"
 * -- is that sector and nothing else.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL. The first design for stage C described
 * the commit as "write the backup, then the primary" and named no
 * file, no function, no CRC32 and no way of generating the new
 * partitions' unique identifiers. An adversarial review pointed out
 * that an implementer would then invent the most dangerous code in the
 * tree over an afternoon, from memory. This is that code, written
 * deliberately.
 *
 * THREE THINGS IT DOES NOT ASSUME
 *
 *   HeaderSize is 92. It is read from the header on the disk. An OEM
 *   that wrote 96 gets a primary header whose CRC covers four bytes
 *   too few; firmware that validates strictly then falls back to the
 *   backup, and the machine boots a layout we did not intend.
 *
 *   An LBA is 512 bytes. It is the disk's logical block size, which is
 *   4096 on a 4Kn drive -- while /sys reports partition starts in
 *   512-byte units whatever the drive is. Those two conventions live
 *   three lines apart in this codebase and confusing them is the 8x
 *   error the risk register names.
 *
 *   There is room for another partition. There may not be, and growing
 *   the entry array would move FirstUsableLBA on top of somebody's
 *   partition. A full table is a refusal.
