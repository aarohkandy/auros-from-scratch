/* disks.c — what is on this machine, read and never written.
 *
 * THE ONLY PLACE IN THIS PROGRAM THAT OPENS A BLOCK DEVICE.
 *
 * It opens them O_RDONLY, and there is no other opener, so "stage A
 * writes nothing" is a property of the code's shape rather than of
 * everybody remembering. When stage C adds a writer it will be a
 * second, obvious, separately-named function, and the diff that adds
 * it will be the diff that has to justify it.
 *
 * Everything here comes from /sys and from reading the first sectors
 * of a device. No libblkid, no udev, no mounting -- especially no
 * mounting. `ntfsresize` refuses a mounted volume, and a Windows
 * volume mounted read-write for even a moment is a volume whose
 * journal we have altered, which is the one thing this environment
 * exists to avoid.

/* ── when nothing turned up ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * "This computer has no disk" is never true, and it is the worst
 * possible thing to tell somebody who is looking at the computer. The
 * useful thing is what IS on the bus: a machine with no storage
 * controller at all is a different problem from one with a RAID
 * controller that has nothing behind it, and the two lead to
 * different support calls.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY NOT A BIOS INSTRUCTION. The commonest cause of this is
 * Intel RST, and the obvious advice -- "change the disk mode to AHCI
 * in your computer's setup screen" -- stops Windows booting at all
 * until somebody does the safe-mode dance afterwards. Handing that
 * sentence to a person on their own is how this product breaks the
 * one thing it promised to preserve. So this states the facts and
 * leaves the instruction to somebody who can stay on the phone.
 *
 * (The VMD driver ships in this image for exactly this reason; see
 * build/staging. This is the message for when it was not enough.)
