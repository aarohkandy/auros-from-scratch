/* notify.h — when a program has something to tell her.
 *
 * Nothing in this image implemented org.freedesktop.Notifications, and
 * that is not a missing nicety. It is the one way a Linux desktop
 * application has of saying anything outside its own window, and every
 * toolkit on the machine calls it:
 *
 *   the browser     a download finished, or failed
 *   her files       the USB stick can be taken out now
 *   the store       the program you asked for is installed
 *   printers        out of paper; the job was sent
 *
 * With no server on the bus, every one of those calls comes back
 * "org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.ServiceUnknown" and the application
 * shrugs. She takes the USB stick out too early, waits for a download
 * that finished ten minutes ago, and presses Install a second time.
 * Nothing anywhere says anything. It is the same shape as every other
 * bug this product keeps finding in itself, one layer out: a thing
 * that looks like it works and does not.
 *
 * WHY THE SHELL AND NOT A PACKAGE
 *
 * The two usual answers do not fit. dunst is X11. mako wants
 * wlr-layer-shell, which this compositor does not implement and should
 * not have to. Both would draw in their own colours, at their own text
 * size, in their own words -- on a machine whose whole argument is
 * that those three things are hers to set.
 *
 * So the shell is the server. It already owns the screen, the theme,
 * her chosen text size and the word list in docs/EASY.md.
 *
 * WHY libdbus
 *
 * The same call the compositor made about libwayland-server. The wire
 * format is not the interesting part, and hand-rolling a parser for
 * a{sv} variants arriving from every program on the machine is a
 * security surface, not a craft exercise. Everything a person SEES
 * here is this program's.
 *
 * TIME AND docs/EASY.md RULE 5
 *
 * A notification goes away by itself, and rule 5 says nothing may be
 * time-limited. It does not break the rule for the same reason the
 * indicator does not: the rule exists so nothing she NEEDS is on a
 * timer. What a notification says is never the only way to learn it --
 * the download is in her Downloads folder either way. What it does
 * have is a long life (eight seconds, not two) and a press-anywhere
 * dismissal, because something that vanishes while she is still
 * reading it is worse than nothing.
