 *
 *     __GI___poll (nfds=1, timeout=-1)
 *       dbus_pending_call_block -> dbus_bus_register -> notify_open
 *
 * for as long as it was left. Nothing painted, no key was read, no
 * click was answered, and no VT switch was acknowledged.
 *
 * That is not a contrived state. $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/bus is a systemd
 * SOCKET unit: it exists and accepts connections before dbus.service
 * is answering on it, which is exactly the boot this whole feature is
 * about. The shell would have found the socket, connected, and stopped
 * being a desktop until the daemon got round to it.
 *
 * So the handshake is a state machine driven by the frame loop, with a
 * deadline this program owns. Hello and RequestName are sent with
 * send_with_reply() and collected in the pump; a reply that does not
 * come in time closes the connection and tries again later. Nothing
 * here waits for anything.
