/* run.h — starting another program, without a shell.
 *
 * The shell has to ask other programs things: how loud the sound is,
 * which networks are in range, whether this computer has Bluetooth.
 * Every one of those is a fork and an exec, and every one of them is
 * handed strings that came from somewhere else -- a network's name, a
 * device's name -- so not one of them may go through a shell. A wifi
 * called `;rm -rf ~` is a name.
 *
 * Two shapes, and the difference matters:
 *
 *   run_detached   we do not want an answer, only the doing. Turning
 *                  the volume down. It returns the moment the fork
 *                  succeeds, so the screen never waits for it.
 *
 *   run_capture    we want the answer and we want it now, because
 *                  something is about to be drawn with it. It BLOCKS,
 *                  with a timeout, so it is only for the places where
 *                  the alternative is drawing a wrong number: start-up,
 *                  and opening a panel. Never in a frame loop, never on
 *                  a keystroke.
 *
 * The long-running asks -- a wifi scan takes seconds -- do not belong
 * here at all. src/aurshell/net.c polls those against the main loop so
 * the desktop keeps painting while it waits.

 * finish" -- and main.c read the union as "it is doing it". So a
 * machine that could not fork, which is exactly the state a machine is
 * in when a person reaches for Turn off, got a button that did nothing
 * and said nothing. That is the bug this function was added to fix,
 * committed inside the fix for it.
 *
 * This exists because run_detached() returning 0 means only "a process
 * was created", and three buttons were reading that as "the machine is
 * turning off". A `systemctl suspend` that policy refuses forks
 * perfectly, exits 1, and nobody looks. Use run_status() where the
 * failure has to be SAID and the wait is not in a frame loop. */
