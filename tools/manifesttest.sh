#  manifesttest — will Windows start the wizard at all?
#
#  The first real Windows PC answered "no": "The application has failed
#  to start because its side-by-side configuration is incorrect." The
#  manifest linked into the wizard had "--" inside an XML comment. XML
#  forbids that, Windows' manifest parser enforces it, and Windows then
#  refuses to create the process -- before a line of AurBridge runs.
#  Wine loaded the same file happily, so every test was green.
#
#  This proves the gate that now stands in the build, including that it
#  goes red: a manifest with "--" in a comment, one with no manifest at
#  all, one that forgot requireAdministrator, and the build itself
#  refusing a broken manifest end to end.
#
#    sh tools/manifesttest.sh [BUILT-WIZARD.exe] [KNOWN-BAD.exe]
#
#  With a built wizard it also checks the manifest inside it, and that
#  it is the source manifest byte for byte. A known-bad .exe (the test
#  build published on 2026-09-25, SHA-256 3e32e929...) must be refused.
#
#  It cannot prove that Windows loads the file: only Windows can.
#  .github/workflows/windows.yml is where that is asked.
