#  signtest — is the thing a stranger double-clicks actually signed?
#
#  The certificate is a purchase and cannot be in a test. Everything
#  else about signing can be, and the parts that go wrong are not the
#  parts people expect:
#
#    - a signature that was never verified after being applied. The
#      first person to find out it did not take is somebody looking at
#      a blue full-screen SmartScreen panel.
#    - signing twice, which appends rather than replaces and produces
#      a binary some verifiers refuse.
#    - SHA-1, which Windows has refused since 2016 and which is still
#      what a tool's default was in some versions.
#    - a signature that survives a byte being changed afterwards --
#      which would mean it is not a signature.
#    - a build that says it signed when nothing did. AurOS ships
#      unsigned by the owner's decision (docs/SIGNING.md), so the
#      property is that the build is honest either way.
#
#  A throwaway CA is made here, so the chain is real and ours.
