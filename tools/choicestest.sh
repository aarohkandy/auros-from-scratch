#  choicestest — does what she chose in the installer reach AurOS?
#
#  rootfs/usr/lib/auros/choices.sh runs at first boot and applies the
#  language, keyboard, time zone, look and desktop that AurBridge wrote
#  to \EFI\AurOS\choices.conf. This runs it against a directory standing
#  in for / (AUROS_CHOICES_ROOT), where it writes files and runs nothing,
#  and checks the files a real system reads:
#
#    /etc/default/locale     LANG             (PAM, systemd)
#    /etc/locale.gen         the locale to generate
#    /etc/default/keyboard   XKBLAYOUT        (aurwl's kb_defaults)
#    /etc/localtime          -> zoneinfo
#    /etc/auros/theme        the next first-boot step's `aurora set`
#    /etc/auros/shell/active.shell -> the archetype
#    /etc/auros/installer-choices.conf   what Ferry must not overwrite
#
#  Windows' own identifiers -- a KLID, a time-zone key name -- are
#  mapped with Ferry's tables, the same ones ferry-settings uses. And
#  the file is input from a FAT partition anybody with Windows could
#  have written, so the last cases are hostile ones: every one must be
#  refused, and must change nothing.
