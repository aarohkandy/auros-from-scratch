# filetypes.sh — does every file type open something that exists?
#
# build/forge writes an /etc/xdg/mimeapps.list saying which program
# handles which kind of file. Every line in it names a .desktop file. If
# that .desktop does not exist -- because the package renamed it, or was
# never in packages_files, or the name was simply guessed -- the line
# does nothing at all. Nothing warns. The file just opens with whatever
# the database happens to rank first, or with nothing.
#
# This is not hypothetical. Two of the six entries were wrong the first
# time they were written: ristretto ships org.xfce.ristretto.desktop and
# mousepad ships org.xfce.mousepad.desktop, not the names anyone would
# assume. A .deb that opens an archive manager instead of an installer
# is how a person ends up with a folder full of files and no program.
#
#   sh tools/filetypes.sh
#
# Needs the packages in packages_files installed on THIS machine, since
# the check is "does this .desktop exist". Exits 2 and says so if they
# are not, rather than passing on an empty search.

#
#   the name is wrong    the table said "gnome-software" and the archive
#                        ships org.gnome.Software.desktop, so the line
#                        renamed a file that is not there
#
#   the name is right    but the package also ships Name[en_US], and the
#   and it still loses   XDG rule -- which src/aurshell/apps.c follows
#                        correctly -- is that an exact language-and-
#                        country match beats the plain Name=. atril does
#                        exactly this, so a freshly booted image read
#                        "Atril Document Viewer" next to "Your files"
