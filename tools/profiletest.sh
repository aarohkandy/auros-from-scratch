#  profiletest — does every version of AurOS build, and start up to
#  its desktop?
#
#  "Every version of our OS a user could want" is five profiles, and
#  until this test only one of them (desktop) was ever built or booted
#  by anything that runs on its own. The other four were last built by
#  hand a month ago, with the browser fallback, before the snap pin --
#  and two of them no longer built at all, in ways nothing reported:
#
#    office   asked for `thunderbird`, which in Ubuntu 24.04 is a
#             120 KB package that installs a snap. forge now pins
#             those to -1, so the install line fails forty minutes in
#             with "no installation candidate".
#    revive   excluded `tracker3`, `tracker3-miners` and
#             `gnome-software-plugin-deb`, none of which exist in
#             noble. apt refuses the whole purge for one unknown name,
#             the build says `|| true`, and NOTHING on the list was
#             removed -- including the things that were there.
#
#  Three modes, cheapest first:
#
#    sh tools/profiletest.sh lint [profile...]
#        Seconds, no root. Every package a profile names exists in its
#        suite, none of them is a snap stub, every name it excludes is
#        a real package (so the purge is not a silent no-op), its theme
#        and its desktop exist, a kiosk names the programs it allows.
#        Reads Ubuntu's own package indexes (downloaded once, cached).
#
#    sudo sh tools/profiletest.sh boot <profile> [evidence-dir]
#        The built image, out/auros-<profile>.img: first what is IN it
#        (read off the disk: the packages, the excludes, the policy,
#        the browser), then started under OVMF in QEMU (KVM when there
#        is one) on a 1280x800 screen, until its desktop is up. A probe
#        unit that is NOT part of AurOS -- it is put into a scratch
#        copy of the image and nothing else -- reports from inside over
#        the serial port: which desktop is running, as whom, in which
#        language, which units failed, how long the start took, how
#        much memory is in use. Then the screen is photographed
#        (PNG, in the evidence directory) and asked whether anything
#        was drawn on it.
#
#    sh tools/profiletest.sh selftest
#        Every check above, shown to FAIL on input made to be wrong: a
#        profile with a snap stub, an unknown package, an unknown
#        exclude, a missing theme; a black screen; a report from a
#        machine whose desktop is not the one the profile asks for.
#
#  Environment:
#    PROFILETEST_PKGS     where the package indexes are cached
#    PROFILETEST_TIMEOUT  seconds to wait for the desktop (default 900)
#    PROFILETEST_MEM      MiB for the VM (default: 2048 for revive --
#                         the machine it is for -- else 4096)
