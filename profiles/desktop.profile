#  AurOS Profile — Desktop (the default)
#
#  A profile is the whole customization surface in one file. Forge
#  reads it and produces a bootable image: branding, theme, language,
#  the app set, and what users are allowed to change.
#
#  This is the file a school or an organisation edits. Everything an
#  administrator could reasonably want to control is here, and nothing
#  here requires touching code.

# Hardware enablement. This is the line that makes WiFi and graphics
# work on a ten-year-old laptop, and it is the single strongest reason
# to sit on an existing base rather than rebuild one.
#
# polkitd decides whether the desktop may turn the computer off, open a
# USB stick, or change the network. network-manager already depends on
# it, so it arrives either way -- it is named here so that it is
# MANUALLY installed and survives the autoremove the build runs, and so
# that a profile which drops network-manager does not silently lose the
# other two as well. Without it those controls appear, press, and
# refuse: controls that look like controls and are not.
# bluez is the Bluetooth stack. It is here because a laptop's mouse,
# its headphones and its keyboard are increasingly all Bluetooth, and a
# machine that cannot pair one is a machine somebody has to find a
# cable for.
#
# cups and its discovery are printing. A person who has had a printer
# for fifteen years expects to press Print. avahi is what finds a
# network printer without being told its address, which is the only
# kind of printing setup she will complete unaided; printer-driver-*
# are the drivers for printers that do not speak a standard language,
# and they are the difference between "it printed" and "it printed
# nothing and said nothing".
#
# FIRMWARE, BY THE PIECE. `linux-firmware` in noble-updates is a
# metapackage over eighteen pieces, and four of them are for machines
# that are not in anybody's house: switch chips (mellanox-spectrum,
# marvell-prestera) and server network cards (netronome, qlogic) --
# about 170 MB of a download that is the floor of her ten minutes.
# linux-firmware-minimal is the empty package that stands in for the
# metapackage (it Provides linux-firmware, which linux-image-generic
# depends on), so the pieces a home PC uses are named one by one.
# build/forge removes the four if anything brought them back anyway,
# and refuses to remove them if that would take the kernel with it.
#
# firmware-sof-signed is the sound on most Intel laptops since about
# 2019 (Sound Open Firmware): without it the speakers and the built-in
# microphone simply do not exist. It is only a Recommends of the
# metapackage, and this build installs no Recommends -- so every image
# before this one shipped with silent laptops. 12 MB. alsa-ucm-conf and
# alsa-topology-conf are the other half: the per-machine descriptions
# that tell the sound stack which SOF output is the speakers and which
# input is the microphone. Under 1 MB together.

# Ubuntu 24.04 machine running Flathub programs and Firefox has: its

# What the user actually opens.
#
# Ubuntu ships Firefox and Chromium ONLY as snap transitional packages,
# so purging snapd (below) removes the browser with them. A desktop
# without a browser is not a product, so the browser comes from a real
# apt repository instead.
#
#   mozilla-apt  Mozilla's official .deb repo (packages.mozilla.org)
#   archive      a real .deb from Ubuntu's own archive
#   snap         Ubuntu's default; requires snapd, slow on old hardware
#   none         headless / appliance builds
#
# browser_fallback is used when the preferred source cannot be reached
# from the build host -- a corporate proxy, an air-gapped builder, a
# blocked domain. Shipping a desktop with no browser because of the
# network the BUILDER was on is not a trade-off anyone chose, and the
# fallback is a real browser rather than an apology.

# IN ORDER, AND EVERY ONE OF THEM IS A DIFFERENT HOST TO BLOCK.
# packages.mozilla.org first; the mozillateam PPA next, which is
# the same binaries built for Ubuntu and is reachable on networks
# that block the first; then the release tarball, checked against
# the SHA256SUMS published beside it, which needs no repository at
# all. Ubuntu's own archive is deliberately NOT in this list: its
# `firefox` is a 120 KB package whose job is to run snap.

# ── Opening things, and getting more things ────────────────────────
#
# Software arrives here the way it arrives on any other Linux machine:
# from the archive, or as a .deb downloaded from a website. There is no
# AurOS-only walled garden, and there is no attempt to run .exe files --
# a .exe is a Windows program and nothing on Linux runs one. What IS
# here is the normal path, made pressable:
#
#   thunar     her files, in a window. Double-clicking something opens
#              it with whatever claims that kind of file, which is what
#              makes "make files openable" true rather than a plan.
#   gdebi      double-click a downloaded .deb and it installs, with a
#              screen first saying what it is. This is the closest thing
#              Linux has to the .exe habit she has had for twenty years,
#              and it is how Google Chrome is actually installed.
#   ristretto  pictures      evince    PDFs
#
#              evince and not atril, which was here: atril draws EPUB
#              through its own copy of WebKit, and that copy (WebKit 4.1
#              and its JavaScriptCore) was 144 MB of the image -- a
#              second browser engine, for a book format she is unlikely
#              ever to open, on a machine whose browser has its own.
#              evince reads PDF, PostScript, DjVu, XPS and comics with
#              the same poppler; it adds 4.5 MB.
#   mousepad   text          xarchiver zip files
#   mpv        music and video. One binary, every format anyone sends
#              her, and it plays a CD-quality file on a 2013 laptop
#              without dropping frames. A computer that cannot play the
#              song her granddaughter emailed her is not "usable for
#              anything"; it was not usable for that.
#   mate-calc  a calculator. 488 KB, and its absence is the kind of
#              thing nobody lists as a requirement and everybody
#              notices on the first afternoon.
#
# The viewers are the light ones (XFCE and MATE) rather than the GNOME

# no; anything else is read as yes. The build normalises it once and

#
# On a personal computer this is obviously yes -- it is her house and
