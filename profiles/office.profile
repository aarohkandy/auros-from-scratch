#  AurOS Profile — Office.
#
#  An organisation's fleet: a charity with forty donated laptops, a
#  practice with six, a library with twelve. Not a kiosk -- the people
#  using these machines do real work on them and need to be able to
#  change things -- and not the personal desktop either, because
#  somebody is responsible for all of them at once and has to be able
#  to say what is on them.
#
#  THE LINE THIS PROFILE DRAWS, and it is a judgement rather than a
#  fact: an administrator may decide what is INSTALLED and how updates
#  arrive; a user may decide how her own machine LOOKS and behaves.
#  Taking the second away is what makes managed fleets miserable, it
#  buys the administrator almost nothing, and the moment a build takes
#  it away somebody starts asking for a personal laptop instead.

#
# NO `thunderbird` HERE, and not because mail does not matter. In
# Ubuntu 24.04 the package called thunderbird is a 120 KB stub whose
# only job is to install a snap; this image has no snapd, and
# build/forge pins those stubs to -1 so neither the build nor the store
# can install a program that is not there. Naming it made the whole
# install line fail ("no installation candidate") and the office image
# stopped building. Mail is the organisation's webmail in Firefox until
# forge can fetch Thunderbird from a real repository the way it fetches
# Firefox; tools/profiletest.sh lint refuses a stub on any list.

# Installing software is the one thing held back, and not because users
# are not to be trusted: it is because forty machines with forty
# different sets of software is forty machines nobody can support, and
# the person who has to support them is usually the one who volunteered.

# EVERYTHING ELSE SHE KEEPS. The wallpaper, the theme, the font size,

# difference between a computer somebody uses and a computer somebody is

# A NAME, BECAUSE THE IMAGE NEEDS ONE.
#
# This said "" and meant "the person who installs it chooses". Nothing
# on the first boot creates an account, so that image would have had
# nobody to log in as -- and forge found out forty minutes into the
# build, with `usermod: user '' does not exist`. The first boot forces
# a password change; an administrator who wants a different name
# renames it, or rebuilds this profile with one. Deferring the choice
# to the installer is a real thing to want and is not built yet.
