# A locked-down build: one browser, no installs, no settings, no shell.
# Demonstrates that the whole lockdown story is data, not code.

# The browser comes from the same mechanism the desktop profile uses --

# packages_apps would install Ubuntu's transitional snap package, and
# this build purges snapd, so the kiosk would boot with nothing to run.
